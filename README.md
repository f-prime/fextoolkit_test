# Blue Pages

Blue Pages is a simple digital phone book web application. It allows a user to lookup a phone number given a first name, last name, and state. 

Blue Pages is far from complete though. Your task is to work on the seven tasks below. 

# Technologies

The frontend uses VueJS and the backend uses Python 3 and the Flask web framework.

# Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Take a look at the design mock up: https://xd.adobe.com/view/4a4d4937-4439-4bfd-b7a8-e52c9d367d0d-1f1e/
2. Get the frontend and backend working. In its current state you should be able to run searches without modifying the code at all.
3. Complete the tasks in any order that you see fit.
4. When you finish a task create a pull request that briefly describes the change.

I don't expect every task to be completed in the time allotted. Play to your strengths and complete the tasks that do the best job of showcasing those strengths.  

# Tasks

- Search is currently very slow an inefficient. See if you can improve the performance.
- Make searching case insensitive.
- Paginate the results instead of having them all show at once. 
- Fix the results box styling to look like the design in Adobe XD
- Fix the input form to look like the design in Adobe XD
- Change the vertical layout to a horizontal layout as shown in Adobe XD
- Refactor the search and results into separate components.
